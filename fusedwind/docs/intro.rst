Introduction
------------

High-level overview of code.  Probably just a few paragraphs.  Math can be added using :math:`\exp^x`, you can refer to other sections like :ref:`theory`, and link to the web like `f2py <http://www.scipy.org/F2py/>`_.

If your intro is really short, you may consider omitting this section and just including your description on the index.rst page.
