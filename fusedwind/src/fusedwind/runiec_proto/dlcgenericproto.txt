# This is an example of a way to implement the IEC load case from 88_329 using a quite
# generic probabalistic language.  Syntax is implementing the general idea that each case
# is simply defining a joint probability distribution on several environment variables like
# wind speed, wave height, directionality, etc.
# That is, the general thing that we need is
#
# <var> ~ <distribution>(<params>), ie
#
# {v_i} = D_k ({p_j}), where
# v_i are variables like wind speed, D_k are distributions like "normal", "uniform", etc, and
# where p_j are parameters that define the given distribution, like mean, variance, etc.
# We also need for the parameters to be functions of the variables (so distribution of wave height
# can depend on wind speed, for example).
# We also need to be able to specify _joint_ distributions.

# So the syntax I've implemented so far allows for 3 cases
# <val> = number | var_name
# <expr> = <val> <op> <val>
# var_name = <expr> | or {<expr1>,...,<exprn>}
# <var>
# TODO: more description... see below for examples.
