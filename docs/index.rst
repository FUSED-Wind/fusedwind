Overview
========

Framework for Unified Systems Engineering and Design of Wind Plants
(FUSED-Wind) is a free open-source framework for multi-disciplinary optimisation and
analysis (MDAO) of wind energy systems, developed jointly by the Wind Energy Department at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Wind Energy) and the National Renewable Laboratory (NREL).
The framework is built as an extension to the NASA developed `OpenMDAO <http://openmdao.org/>`_, and
defines key interfaces, methods and I/O variables necessary for wiring together different
simulation codes in order to achieve a system level analysis capability of wind
turbine plants with multiple levels of fidelity.
NREL and DTU have developed independent interfaces to their respective
simulation codes and cost models with the aim
of offering an environment where these codes can be used interchangeably.
The open source nature of the framework enables third parties to develop
interfaces to their own tools, either replacing or extending those offered by
DTU and NREL.

GitHub Repository
