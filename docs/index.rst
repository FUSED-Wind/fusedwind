Overview
--------

Welcome to the Framework for Unified Systems Engineering and Design of Wind
Turbine Plants ( FUSED-Wind).
This is an open-source framework for multi-disciplinary optimisation and
analysis (MDAO) of wind energy systems, developed jointly by DTU and NREL.
The framework is designed as an extension to the NASA developed OpenMDAO, and
defines key I/O elements and methods necessary for wiring together different
simulation codes in order to achieve a system level analysis capability of wind
turbine plants with multiple levels of fidelity.
NREL and DTU have developed independent interfaces to their respective
simulation codes and cost models (e.g. FAST/CCBlade, HAWC2/BECAS) with the aim
of offering an environment where these codes can be used interchangeably.
The open source nature of the framework enables third parties to develop
interfaces to their own tools, either replacing or extending those offered by
DTU and NREL.
